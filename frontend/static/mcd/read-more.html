          <h2>What exactly is MCD?</h2>
          <p class="static-content-paragraph">
            The short answer is that MCD is a novel framework for counterfactual
            optimization in design problems. For the long answer, please refer
            to our
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11308"> public access paper </a>
            or our
            <a

            >
              open-source implementation of MCD </a
            >.

          <h2>What's actually happening in the interactive demo?</h2>
          <p class="static-content-paragraph">
            The chosen rider-bike combination is passed to MCD, which has been
            equipped with a method that evaluates ergonomic score/aerodynamic
            drag, depending on the type of optimization being performed. Riders
            are represented by 8 bodily dimensions, whereas bikes are
            represented by 14. MCD will attempt to produce as many unique, novel
            designs that meet specific performance targets, while also
            trying to keep generated designs as similar to the original bike as
            possible.

          <h2>What else can MCD be used for?</h2>
          <p class="static-content-paragraph">
            All sorts of design/optimization problems. MCD places no
            restrictions on parametric design representation, with integer,
            continuous, and categorical variables supported. MCD also places
            no restriction on the type of model used for performance
            predictions. This means MCD will work just as well with
            differentiable and non-differentiable machine learning models, as
            well as simulation or pure mathematical models.

          <p class="static-content-paragraph">Of course!</p>
          <h4>Multiobjective structural optimization</h4>
          <p class="inner-static-content-paragraph">
            Equipped with a machine learning model capable of predicting
            structural properties from 39 design parameters, MCD has been used
            to optimize bikes for properties such as weight and safety factor
            (i.e. the ratio of the maximum stress a bike can withstand to that
            of a typical loading scenario).
          </p>
          <h4>Cross-modal design recommendations with text prompts</h4>
          <p class="inner-static-content-paragraph">
            Making use of a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model,
            MCD was used to generate novel bike designs that resembled prompts
            such as 'A futuristic black cyberpunk-style road racing bicycle' and
            'A sturdy compact bright blue mountain bike with thick tires'.

            We would like to thank Noah Wiley for his contributions to the
            image-to-rider-dimensions pipeline, as well as the ergonomic and
            aerodynamic performance prediction functions. We would also like to
            thank Amin Heyrani Nobari for his work on the bike rendering
            pipeline, and Brent Curry for allowing us to make use of the
            <a href="https://www.bikecad.ca/">BikeCAD</a> bicycle design
            software for this demo.
